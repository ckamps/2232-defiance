## Buffered from neighbors yet easy access to area services

Nestled between two high-end communities with large 5-acre and 3-acre lots, bordered on three sides by dense woods and river bluff buffs and on two sides by the Katy Trail State Park and the Femme Osage Creek, the property provides highly sought after isolation. Yet you're only a 20-minute drive from a wide variety of services in Chesterfield Valley, O'Fallon, and Lake St Louis.

## Gateway to Missouri wine country

Situated well above the adjacent Femme Osage Creek and Missouri River bottoms on its own private parcel in the sparsely-developed southwest portion of St Charles County, this property sits at the gateway to Missouri's wine country.

## Views of the opposite bluffs of the Missouri River

In winter, enjoy expansive south-facing panoramic views for miles across undeveloped bottom lands toward the south side of the Missouri River. You won't see structures of the adjacent properties from the home's numerous windows. The closest homes in view are those situated in St Albans, 2+ miles away in Franklin County atop the south bluffs of the Missouri River. In other seasons, you'll enjoy filtered forms of the same views.

## Classic style with modern amenities

Custom built in 2006 with a classic craftsman style exterior and seven gables, the home has been kept up-to-date with the latest technology. For example, gigabit fiber internet service was connected in 2022 along with the installation of new WiFi access points throughout the home, garage, and outdoor spaces. High-speed internet coupled with a dedicated home office space with a view and easy access to outdoor areas for breaks, makes the home ideal for remote working.

## Private Femme Osage Creek frontage and access to the Missouri River
