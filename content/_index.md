## Buffered From Neighbors Yet Within Easy Access to Area Services

Nestled between two high-end communities with large 5-acre and 3-acre lots and bordered on three sides by dense woods and river bluff buffs and two sides by the Katy Trail State Park and the Femme Osage Creek, the property provides highly sought after isolation. Yet you're only a 20-minute drive from a wide variety of services in Chesterfield Valley, O'Fallon, and Lake St Louis.

## Gateway to Missouri wine country

Situated well above the adjacent Femme Osage Creek and Missouri River bottoms on its own private parcel in the sparsely-developed southwest portion of St Charles County, this property sits at the gateway to Missouri's wine country.

## Views galore

#### Views of the opposite bluffs of the Missouri River

In winter, enjoy 180-degree south-facing panoramic views for miles across undeveloped bottom lands toward the south side of the Missouri River. You won't see structures of the adjacent properties from the home's numerous windows. The closest homes in view are those situated in St Albans, 2+ miles away in Franklin County atop the south bluffs of the Missouri River. In other seasons, you'll enjoy filtered forms of the same views.

#### Femme Osage Creek Bridge: The region's largest yard art

From many areas of the yard and home, enjoy a commanding and intimate view of the 120+ year-old iron railroad bridge spanning the Femme Osage Creek that is just ~250 feet away and ~60 feet below the main level of the home. You'll feel like you're on vacation whenever you see the bridge!

## Classic style with modern amenities

Custom built in 2006 with a classic arts and crafts exterior and seven gables, the home has been kept up-to-date with the latest technology. For example, gigabit fiber internet service was connected in 2022 along with the installation of new WiFi access points throughout the home, garage, and outdoor spaces. High-speed internet coupled with a dedicated home office space with a view and easy access to outdoor areas for breaks, makes the home ideal for remote working.

## Private Katy trail access

With over 400 feet of frontage on the [Katy Trail State Park](https://mostateparks.com/park/katy-trail-state-park), the longest developed rail-trail in the country, you'll have private access to over 240 miles of trail. Great for walking, running, and biking, the trail provides ready access to nearby wineries, restaurants, and other parks in the Defiance and Augusta. Venture further afield, and you can use the Katy trail to ride to old town St Charles, Chesterfield Valley, Washington, Missouri, and beyond.

From your backyard, it's an easy ~1-mile walk or bike ride on the Katy trail to [Defiance Ridge Vineyards](https://www.defianceridgevineyards.com/) and [Good News Brewery](https://www.goodnewsbrewing.com/) in Defiance. The jewel of [Klondike Park](https://www.sccmo.org/690/Klondike-Park) is just a 20-minute bike ride away while the wineries and restaurants of [Augusta](https://www.townofaugustamo.org/) are only 40 minutes by trail. 

## Private Femme Osage Creek frontage and access to the Missouri River

Use your private dock on over 260 feet of [Femme Osage Creek](https://www.anyplaceamerica.com/directory/mo/st-charles-county-29183/streams/femme-osage-creek-756042/) shoreline to set off on paddle boarding, kayaking, canoeing, and fishing adventures. When the water's high enough, you'll have 1.75 miles of secluded paddling from your home all the way to its confluence with the Missouri River.
