## Katy Trail State Park 

With over 400 feet of frontage on the [Katy Trail State Park](https://mostateparks.com/park/katy-trail-state-park), the longest developed rail-trail in the country, you'll have private access to over 240 miles of trail. Great for walking, running, and biking, the trail provides ready access to nearby wineries, restaurants, and other parks in the Defiance and Augusta. Venture further afield, and you can use the Katy trail to ride to old town St Charles, Chesterfield Valley, Washington, Missouri, and beyond.

From your backyard, it's an easy ~1-mile walk or bike ride on the Katy trail to [Defiance Ridge Vineyards](https://www.defianceridgevineyards.com/) and [Good News Brewery](https://www.goodnewsbrewing.com/) in Defiance. The jewel of [Klondike Park](https://www.sccmo.org/690/Klondike-Park) is just a 20-minute bike ride away while the wineries and restaurants of [Augusta](https://www.townofaugustamo.org/) are only 40 minutes by trail.

## Femme Osage Creek and Missouri River access

Use your [private dock]({{<ref "02-the-property#private-dock" >}}) on over 260 feet of the Femme Osage Creek to set off on paddle boarding, kayaking, canoeing, and fishing adventures. You'll have 1.75 miles of secluded floating down the Femme Osage prior to the confluence with the Missouri River. There are no other homes and structures in use on the creek between this home and the Missouri River.

### Paddle boarding and canoeing

During spring, summer, and early fall, you can typically paddle board for more than a mile from the home downstream toward the Missouri River. Canoeing is typically available year round.

### Fishing and boating

The home's Femme Osage Creek shoreline and private dock offer access to a wide variety of fish species and at least ~2 miles of length for fishing. Via the creek, you also have access to the Missouri River. If you're into boating on the river, you could conceivably establish a basic boat ramp on the property to enable access to the creek and the river.

### River and creek water levels

Winter is typically the low water season for the Femme Osage Creek. During winter, springs feed the creek and ensure that there's a minimum water level. At a minimum water level, the creek is usable for fishing and canoeing downstream toward the Missouri River.

As spring arrives and snowmelt and rain occur in the upper Missouri River basin, the river level rises and typically begins to back up into the creek. We call the resulting rise of the creek the backwater state of the creek. A certain levels of backwater, you can paddle a canoe or paddleboard all the way from the home to the river 1.75 miles away. At higher backwater levels, john boats are able to navigate from the river all the way up the creek and even past the home.

The National Weather Service (NWS) has a river water level and flow [monitoring station at Washington MO](https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?gage=whgm7&wfo=lsx). By monitoring the Washington gauge, you can get a good idea of the impact to the water level of the Femme Osage Creek.

To give you an idea of how the creek water levels change over a typical year and across years, the following graph shows river water levels at Washington for the past 13 years along with key river water levels that enable certain activies and distances along the creek.
