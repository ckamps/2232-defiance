## Networking and internet

The property has two gigabit fiber internet services available. Brightspeed's Gigabit service - up to 900Mbps up and down - is currently integrated with the home. Spectrum's fiber service is also available on the property.

A 12U size network rack in the lower unfinished area houses the following components:

A separate rack in the garage houses the internet fiber modem and other equipment. See [Garage TV and Networking]({{<ref "06-garage#tv-and-networking" >}}) for details.

## Wireless access points

All wireless access points were installed in 2022 at about the same time gigabit fiber internet service was established. Depending on your device, the WiFi 6 access points are capable of providing up to ~500Mbps wireless speeds throughout the home and outside. (Wired ethernet speeds are higher).

## Outdoor cameras

A series of Power Over Ethernet (PoE) network cameras are positioned outside the home to enable you to view the surroundings when you're home and away.

A {{< link hik-nvr >}}Hikvision DS-7616NI-I2/16P{{</link >}} Network Video Recorder (NVR) provides local storage for events and recordings. The Hikvison Hik Connect mobile app can be used to receive alerts and access your camera feeds from home and away. Since the NVR is in your home, there are no monthly subscription fees required to access your cameras and recordings.

Cameras cover the following outside areas:

| |
|-|
|Entry road hill - north facing|
|Entry road hill - south facing|
|Driveway|
|Autocourt and front of home|
|Garage interior|
|Porch|

## Home automation

{{< link hubitat >}}Hubitat{{</link >}} home automation hubs enable control and automation of a wide variety of devices within the home. Three Hubitat devices are meshed and located in the living room (C-8 version), lower level (C-7 version), and garage (C-8 version). The hubs support Z-Wave, Zigbee, Apple HomeKit, and Matter (C-8 only).

Apple TVs distributed throughout the home act as Apple Home hubs. Currently, most of the home's smart switches and other devices are registered with the Hubitat devices. In turn, the Hubitat devices use their built-in support for HomeKit to make the devices available via the Apple Home app on iOS devices.

You have the option to define automation through the Apple Home app, Hubitat, or both.

Examples of remote control and automation already in place include:

| |
|-|
|Voice assistant control of living room fireplace. "Alexa, turn on the fireplace"|
|Voice assistant control of garage doors|
|Automatic early morning and evening inside and outdoor lighting schedules|
|Automatic arming the home security system in the late evening|
|Automatic turning on/off ceiling fans based on inside temperature|
|Automated monitoring of indoor and outdoor humidity levels and control of the whole house humidifier to align with target humidity level|
