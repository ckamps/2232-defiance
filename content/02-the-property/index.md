The property is nestled between the established Ridge Creek and Markham Hills developments that have minimum lots sizes of 3+ and 5 acres respectively. Bracketed on two sides by limestone bluffs and two sides by the Femme Osage Creek and Katy Trail State Park, the property provides you with a front row seat to the views of the Missouri River Valley and easy access to a variety of recreational activities. Since it's a standalone parcel, you won't have any fees and restrictions associated with Home Owners Associations (HOAs).
