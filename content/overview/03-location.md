## Desirable Defiance Area

Don't miss this opportunity to own a unique 5.25-acre property and custom home in the desirable Defiance area of St Louis, Missouri. Whether you work from home or commute, the setting will make you feel like you're always at a weekend retreat.

Situated well above the adjacent Femme Osage Creek and Missouri River bottoms on its own private parcel in the sparsely-developed southwest portion of St Charles County, this property sits at the gateway to Missouri's wine country.

Nestled between two high-end communities with large 5-acre and 3-acre lots, bordered on three sides by dense woods and river bluff buffs and on two sides by the Katy Trail State Park and the Femme Osage Creek, the property provides a highly sought after country feeling. Yet you're only a 20-minute drive from a wide variety of services in Chesterfield Valley, O'Fallon, and Lake St Louis.
