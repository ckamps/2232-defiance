The fully finished, south facing, oversized 3-car+ garage is tucked into the bluff to minimize it's visual impact on the site. West- and south-facing shingle clad roof gables make the generously sized garage appear to be a natural extension of the main home. 

A hide away retractable metal ladder provides easy access to the large upper level storage attic. A great place to store infrequently used items.
