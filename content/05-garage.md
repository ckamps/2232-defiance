The fully finished, south-facing, oversized 3-car+ garage is tucked into the bluff to minimize it's visual impact on the site. West- and south-facing shingle clad roof gables make the generously sized garage appear to be a natural extension of the main home. 

The fully enclosed breezeway provides sheltered access to the main level.

A hide away retractable metal ladder provides easy access to the large upper level storage attic. A great place to store infrequently used items.

## Floor Plan

Oversize 48' wide x 30' deep 3-car+ garage with 3 separate garage doors.
