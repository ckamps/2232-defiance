## Highlights
Custom built in 2006 with a classic craftsman style exterior and seven gables, the home has been kept up-to-date with the latest technology. 

For example, gigabit fiber internet service was connected in 2022 along with the installation of new WiFi access points throughout the home, garage, and outdoor spaces. High-speed internet coupled with a dedicated home office space with a view and easy access to outdoor areas for breaks, makes the home ideal for remote working.

## Desirable Defiance area

Situated well above the adjacent Femme Osage Creek and Missouri River bottoms on its own private parcel in the sparsely-developed southwest portion of St Charles County, this property sits at the gateway to Missouri's wine country.

Nestled between two high-end communities with large 5-acre and 3-acre lots, bordered on three sides by dense woods and river bluff buffs and on two sides by the Katy Trail State Park and the Femme Osage Creek, the property provides a highly sought after country feeling. Yet you're only a 20-minute drive from a wide variety of services in Chesterfield Valley, O'Fallon, and Lake St Louis.

## The views

In winter, enjoy expansive south-facing panoramic views for miles across undeveloped bottom lands toward the south side of the Missouri River. You won't see structures of the adjacent properties from the home's numerous windows. The closest homes in view are those situated in St Albans, 2+ miles away in Franklin County atop the south bluffs of the Missouri River. In other seasons, you'll enjoy filtered forms of the same views.

## 120-year-old iron railroad bridge

From many areas of the yard and home, enjoy a commanding and intimate view of the 120-year-old iron railroad bridge spanning the Femme Osage Creek. The bridge is just ~250 feet away and ~60 feet below the main level of the home. You'll feel like you're on vacation whenever you see the bridge!

## Femme Osage Creek and Missouri River

When the water's high enough, you'll have 1.75 miles of secluded paddling from your home all the way to its confluence with the Missouri River.

Great for walking, running, and biking, the trail provides ready access to nearby wineries, restaurants, and other parks in the Defiance and Augusta. Venture further afield, and you can use the Katy trail to ride to old town St Charles, Chesterfield Valley, Washington, Missouri, and beyond.
