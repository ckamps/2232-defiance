## Main level and garage

The majority of your day-to-day living space is on the main level. Spaces include the laundry/mud room, kitchen, dining room, deck, sun room, living room and three bedrooms including the primary bedroom. See [Main Level]({{<ref "04-main-level" >}}) for details.

The fully finished, over sized three-car+ garage has a fully enclosed breezeway that provides easy access to the home. A large storage attic with folding access stairs enables you to store infrequently used items out of the way. See [Garage]({{<ref "06-garage" >}}) for details.

## Lower level

The walkout finished lower level is great for working from home, guests, movies, and games. Spaces include an office, kitchenette, TV/recreation room, home theater, full bath, and fourth bedroom. Additionally, there's an abundance of partially finished, storage, and mechanical space. See [Lower Level]({{<ref "05-lower-level" >}}) for details.

## Optional accessory structure

Take advantage of an already approved county variance to build an accessory structure on the property. The approved variance calls for an accessory structure of 34' x 24' deep (816 sq feet) with an interior ceiling height of ~10'. The structure would be positioned at least 10' from the north side property line, at least 50' from the west property line, and roughly in line with the existing attached garage. The front of the structure would be either parallel to or slightly behind the front line of the existing attached garage and would not be overlapping with the main living structure of the existing home. This variance does not expire.

If you'd like to construct a larger accessory structure, you could vie for another variance that goes beyond the dimensions referenced in the existing variance. Per county development ordinance, the maximum size of an accessory structure for a 5.25-acre parcel in the agricultural district of the county is 4,800 sq ft. See the {{< link udc >}}St Charles County Unified Development Ordinance{{</link >}} for details on accessory structure requirements.
