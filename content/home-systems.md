## Security System

Although the home is difficult for people to access either via the entry road or by foot on the Katy trail, it's nice to have the extra security of a built-in home security alarm system and cameras.

## Outdoor Cameras

A series of Power Over Ethernet (PoE) cameras are positioned outside the home to enable you to view the surroundings when you're home and away. A Hikvision Network Video Recorder (NVR) provides local storage for events and recordings. The Hikivison mobile app can be used to access your camera feeds from home and away.
