## Security System

Although the home is difficult for people to access either via the entry road or by foot on the Katy trail, it's nice to have the extra security of a built-in home security alarm system and cameras.

|Home automation integration|[EyezOn EnvisaLink 4](https://www.eyezon.com/evl4.php) module connects to the security system as a third keypad and connects to the home network. The module enables the security systems to be integrated with the home automation system so that you can control and monitor the system using your phone and automate actions based on events such as exterior doors opening and closing.|

## Outdoor Cameras

A series of Power Over Ethernet (PoE) network cameras are positioned outside the home to enable you to view the surroundings when you're home and away. A [Hikvision DS-7616NI-I2/16P](https://www.hikvision.com/au-en/products/IP-Products/Network-Video-Recorders/Pro-Series/ds-7616ni-i2-16p/) Network Video Recorder (NVR) provides local storage for events and recordings. The Hikvison Hik Connect mobile app can be used to receive alerts and access your camera feeds from home and away. Since the NVR is in your home, there are no monthly subscription fees required to access your cameras and recordings.

## Doorbell and Camera

A Ring Doorbell Pro is positioned at the main entry door.

## Networking

Although secluded, the property has two gigabit fiber internet services available. Currently, Brightspeed's 900Mbps service is integrated with the home. Alternatively, Spectrum fiber service also services the immediate area.

The included [UniFi Dream Machine Pro](https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/udm-pro) makes managing and keeping up-to-date the home network and wireless access points simple.

### Wireless Access Points

All wireless access points were installed ~2022 at about the same time gigabit fiber internet service was established. Depending on your device, the WiFi 6 access points are capable of providing up to ~500Mbps speeds throughout the home and outside.
