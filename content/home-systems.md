## Security System

Although the home is difficult for people to access either via the entry road or by foot on the Katy trail, it's nice to have the extra security of a built-in home security alarm system and cameras.

|Keypads|2: Master suite and mud room|
|Exterior door contact sensors|All exterior doors have built-in contact sensors|
|Glass break sensors|All rooms with glass windows accessible to ground level have glass break sensors|
|Smoke sensor|Smoke sensor integrated with security system (apart from standard battery powered smoke and CO2 sensors)|
|Home automation integration|[EyezOn EnvisaLink 4](https://www.eyezon.com/evl4.php) module connects to the security system as a third keypad and connects to the home network. The module enables the security systems to be integrated with the home automation system so that you can control and monitor the system using your phone and automate actions based on events such as exterior doors opening and closing.|

## Outdoor Cameras

A series of Power Over Ethernet (PoE) network cameras are positioned outside the home to enable you to view the surroundings when you're home and away. A Hikvision DS-7616NI-I2/16P Network Video Recorder (NVR) provides local storage for events and recordings. The Hikvison Hik Connect mobile app can be used to access your camera feeds from home and away. Since the NVR is in your home, there are no monthly subscription fees required to access your cameras and recordings.
