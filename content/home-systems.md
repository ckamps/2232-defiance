## Outdoor Cameras

A series of Power Over Ethernet (PoE) network cameras are positioned outside the home to enable you to view the surroundings when you're home and away.

A [Hikvision DS-7616NI-I2/16P](https://www.hikvision.com/au-en/products/IP-Products/Network-Video-Recorders/Pro-Series/ds-7616ni-i2-16p/) Network Video Recorder (NVR) provides local storage for events and recordings. The Hikvison Hik Connect mobile app can be used to receive alerts and access your camera feeds from home and away. Since the NVR is in your home, there are no monthly subscription fees required to access your cameras and recordings.

Cameras cover the following outside areas:

## Home Automation

[Hubitat](https://hubitat.com/) home automation hubs enable control and automation of a wide variety of devices within the home. Three Hubitat devices are meshed and located in the living room (C-8 version), lower level (C-7 version), and garage (C-8 version). The hubs support Z-Wave, Zigbee, Apple HomeKit, and Matter (C-8 only).

Apple TVs distributed throughout the home act as Apple Home hubs. Currently, most of the home's smart switches and other devices are registered with the Hubitat devices. In turn, the Hubitat devices use their built-in support for HomeKit to make the devices available via the Apple Home app on iOS devices.

You have the option to define automations through the Apple Home app, Hubitat, or both.

Examples of remote control and automation already in place include:

| |
|-|
|Voice assistant control of living room fireplace. "Alexa, turn on the fireplace"|
|Voice assistant control of garage doors|
|Automatic early morning and evening inside and outdoor lighting schedules|
|Automatic arming the home security system in the late evening|
|Automatic turning on/off ceiling fans based on inside temperature|
|Automated monitoring of indoor and outdoor humidity levels and control of the whole house humidifier to align with target humidity level|
